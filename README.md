What does the Musixmatch API do?

The Musixmatch API allows you to read objects from our huge 100% licensed lyrics database.

To make your life easier we are providing you with one or more examples to show you how it could work in the wild. You’ll find both the API request and API response in all the available output formats for each API call. Follow the links below for the details.

The current API version is 1.1, the root URL is located at http://api.musixmatch.com/ws/1.1/

Supported input parameters can be found on the page Input Parameters. Use UTF-8 to encode arguments when calling API methods.

Every response includes a status_code. A list of all status codes can be consulted at Status Codes.

Do you have an idea or suggestion for an API call that you don’t see here? Let us know and we’ll do our best to respond!
